                Hey there, my name is Collin Newberg 
                and I am a senior at Syracuse University
                studying information management & technology
                as well as public relations. I love my dogs
                and playing video games and spend a lot of my
                time hanging out with the roomies. It's a good 
                time. Nice to meet you. I'm super excited for this
                class.
            </p>

                I love buffalo chicken wraps in all honesty.
            </p>
            <p>I also love chicken parm, basically any type of
                chicken dish I'm totally fine with consuming.
